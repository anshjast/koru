# Koru - A Personal Self-Improvement App

This is a personal Flutter application I am building to improve in areas like fitness, daily habits, and life skills. The app is named 'Koru', symbolizing new life and growth.

## Current Progress (as of Sept 14, 2025)
- [x] Project setup with Flutter and a Firebase backend.
- [x] Implemented a multi-screen flow: Splash Screen -> "Big 3" Entry -> Main Dashboard.
- [x] The "Big 3" feature is fully functional. It can save daily priorities to Firestore and display them in real-time on the dashboard.
- [x] Established a dark theme and a clean UI structure.

## Next Steps
- Build out the main dashboard with widgets for all six core modules (The Engine, The Fuel, etc.).
